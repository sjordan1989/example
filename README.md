##WOrking with main banch (bad)
- Git status checks your progress/chagne in your computer vs cloud
- Git add the files you are ready to add to the cloud
-Git commit -m"<Specify work done>"
- Git push   -----synchronize local with the cloud
-

##Working with branhces (good)
-Git checkout main and perform a git pull (shunchronize cloud with local)
git status to see no changes
1. Git branch (Seeing asterisk on main)
2. Git branch <newBranchname>
3. Git checkout <newBranchnameis>
4. Do the work you need to do
-git status to control
5. Git add the files
6. Git commit -m "work"
7. Git push (copy the error if first time branch)
8. Go to the cloud, and accept these chagnes
9. When you finally "merge" on the cloud, we need to go to line 1 of this process
